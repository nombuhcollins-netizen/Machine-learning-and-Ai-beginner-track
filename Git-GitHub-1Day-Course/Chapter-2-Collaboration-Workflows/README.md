## Real-World Workflow

```
Developer                    GitHub                    Team

1. Create branch
   (feature-login) ──────────────────────────────────────→
   
2. Make commits
   
3. Push to GitHub ─────→ feature-login branch created
   
4. Create PR ──────────→ PR opened on GitHub
   
                        ← Code review from team
5. Review comments
