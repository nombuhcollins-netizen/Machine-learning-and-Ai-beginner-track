## Exercise 1: Dataset Class

Create a simple Dataset class:
\`\`\`python
# Store features and labels
# Calculate statistics (mean, std, min, max)
# Normalize features
# Get batch of samples
\`\`\`

## Exercise 2: Feature Scaling

\`\`\`python
# Standard scaling: (x - mean) / std
# Min-Max scaling: (x - min) / (max - min)
# Implement both as functions
\`\`\`

## Exercise 3: Label Encoding

\`\`\`python
# Map labels to integers
# "cat" -> 0, "dog" -> 1
# Create bidirectional mapping
\`\`\`

## Exercise 4: Confusion Matrix

\`\`\`python
# Given predictions and true labels
# Count true positives, false positives, etc.
# Calculate precision and recall
\`\`\`

## Exercise 5: Data Augmentation

\`\`\```python
# Add noise to features
# Create synthetic variations
# Shuffle dataset
\`\`\`
